# Discussify Privacy Policy

> First Posted: February 18, 2019
> Last Update: February 18, 2019

The Discussify browser extension is owned by Protocol Labs Inc. and created by the IPFS Project. We know you care about how your personal data is used and we take your privacy seriously. **By using Discussify, you are accepting and agreeing to our collection and use of your information in the ways described below. At the moment, we only plan to use the information you provided to us for analytics to run and improve Discussify platform. We don’t plan to sell it to anyone else or use it for advertising. If that changes, we'll let you know by updating this policy.**

### What Does this Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy explains how we gather and use some of your Personal Data. But it doesn’t apply to projects run by other organizations outside IPFS and Protocol Labs, even if we promote the use of those projects or happen to contribute to them. The Personal Data you provide to us is or may be used for (i) syncing the list of Discussify discussions you participate in across browsers and devices, (ii) serving as your login credentials, (iii) communicating directly to you through your email address in order to give you information about our products, services, updates and upgrades, and (iv) analyzing how you use Discussify so we can make improvements. Some of your Personal Data, such as your name and avatar, will be stored on the IPFS website publicly, and because Discussify's discussions & comments are public, they are accessible to everyone who uses the extension or who queries the data on IPFS.

If you are under the age of majority in your place of residence, you may use Discussify only with the consent of or under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian. As required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), if we learn that we have received any information directly from a child under age 13 without first receiving his or her parent's verified consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) to inform the child that he or she cannot use Disussify and we will delete that information.

### Will We Ever Change this Privacy Policy?

We’re constantly trying to improve Discussify, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy sometimes. When we do, we will update the date at the top of the Privacy Policy.  If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will try to inform you [here](/privacy-policy.md) ([https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-discussify/blob/master/privacy-policy.md](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-discussify/blob/master/privacy-policy.md)), and if you gave us your email address then we will also try to use that to contact you. Ultimately, however, it is your responsibility to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed. If you use Discussify after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of those changes.   

### What Information Do We Collect?

#### Information You Give Us

Through the online registration process with uPort, we receive and store the information you provide to us including your name, email address, phone number, avatar, and account credentials. Your interactions with and the Personal Information you provide to uPort are also governed by uPort’s own privacy policy (which is different from ours) which is available here: [https://www.uport.me/privacy-policy](https://www.uport.me/privacy-policy).

If you’ve given us your email address and opted-in to receive our updates, we may send you emails about Discsussify, IPFS or Protocol Labs. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please do not opt-in to receive these updates.  

#### Information Collected Automatically

Whenever you use Discussify, some information from your browser or device will automatically be received and recorded (either on the IPFS platform, our web storage platform, or on a third party’s servers, such as Google Analytics). This information may include things like your IP address, geolocation data, operation system, device identification, the type of browser and device you’re using, the pages you viewed while using Discussify, and the time spent on those pages, the frequency with which Discussify is used by a user, search terms, and other statistics. We use this information to administer Discussify and we may analyze (or may engage third parties like Google Analytics to analyze) this information to improve Discussify and expand its features and functionality.

If you disable the Discussify extension, or close your browser, we do not track your online activity and we won’t be able to collect or store information.  

**Some of Your Personal Information will be Publicly Available and Stored.**
We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. But because Discussify is a web extension that provides a real-time, peer-to-peer and permanent discussion platform for anyone to join and participate, the comments that you make using Discussify are publicly available and accessible to everyone who uses Discussify or who queries the data on IPFS. Some of your Personal Information, such as your name and avatar, will be stored on the IPFS website publicly as well.

**User Profiles and Submissions:** Certain user profile information, including your name and avatar, will be displayed to other users to allow Discussify users to post comments and replies within Discussify. The posts and any content you upload will also be displayed to other users when you create them through the Discussify discussion platform.

**Protection of Company and Others:** We may use your personal information as we believe necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, lawful requests and legal process, such as to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities.

**What Personal Information Can I Access?** Through your account settings with uPort, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the information you’ve provided.

**What if I have questions about this policy?**
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a message at [legalrequests@protocol.ai](mailto:legalrequests@protocol.ai).
